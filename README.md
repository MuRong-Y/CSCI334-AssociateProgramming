## Limitation:
It can only calculate 2nd order and 3rd order that can be decided by users with combination of all possible values of specific columns that are entered by users (NOT permute for all possibles, only for the columns that user enter). 
It cannot deal with general problems with 4 or more orders. 
In the input file, first line is threshold, second line is row and column number, third line is # of states for each variable. 
The function below end by 2 is work for Order 2, and end by 3 is work for Order 3. 
The user must press the correct number in the question, otherwise it will report an error or end the operation.
